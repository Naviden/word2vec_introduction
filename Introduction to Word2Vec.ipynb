    "\n",
    "The reason for it is relatively simple: to be able to communicate about the world around them, which directly impacts their lives. So, they create \"representations\" (which are not limited to words) to transfer an idea/concept/meaning to another human. While in the beginning, these words/sounds/... were just independent symbols, by the evolution of human language, words were also evolved not only as symbols but also as a way to link other concepts together. This process has happened for thousands of years. During this period, the human brain was unable to create a model of reality, to link words(symbols) not just assign them to a single concept/idea but to understand their dynamics with the other symbols. So when I ask you \"give me a pair of scissors to cut this rope \", if you can't find scissors and instead see a knife, you will probably bring it to me because in the model your brain has from reality, scissors are used to cut, just like a knife. While at first glance it may seem trivial, actually trying to replicate this phenomenon outside the human brain won't be so simple! Before going in deep to see what options are out, let us review how the human brain deals with words:\n",

We can see that these neighbours are almost the same (they are different combinations of $X$ and $Y$ ).

On the contrary, analyzing context words of $A$ and $B$ in the image on the right, we notice that the contexts of $A$ and $B$ are not similar( at least not as they were in the previous case), so we can say that in this case $A$ and $B$ do not have a similar concepts/meaning."

    "Now that we have seen a simplified example and its main differences with Word2Vec let us see in more detail how Word2Vec works:\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, We need to have a large amount of textual data. It is important to notice that these data are not a collection of individual words but a big set of sentences (corpus). Assuming that our corpus has $T$ words, we can address each word like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[ t = 1,2,...,T]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we assume that each word in this limited vocabulary is representable by a vector, and to start, we assign each word a random vector. Iterating through all corpus, we pick each word (centre word $w_{j}$) and assume that it (its representation in this case) should be able to predict its context. Each word's context is the words in a window with a length of $m$ around it. We repeat these iterations hundreds of thousands of times, changing the representation so that the prediction will be better. We can summarise what we have said until now in the following formula, which calculates the likelihood of our model:\n",
    "$$L(\\theta ) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} \\prod_{-m\\leqslant j\\leqslant m} P(w_{t+j}\\mid w_{t};\\theta)$$\n",
    "$$j\\neq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{L}$: Model Likelihood or how good is our model in predicting context from centre words\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$: Model variables we need to optimise. In our case, the only variable we have in hand is the vector representations of words. It means the only thing that defines our probability model's performance is the vectors we come with for each word in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{m}$: The window size for the context words around the centre word\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{P(w_{t+j}\\mid w_{t};\\theta)}$: Probability of having $w_{t+j}$ as a context word given the $w_{t}$ as center word and $\\theta$ as vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While calculating the model performance (model likelihood) for a specific $\\theta$ is good, we need something that helps us find the best $\\theta$. We use a specific function called \"objective function\"(or loss function), which is a transformation of the model likelihood. Doing such a transformation, we will have $J(\\theta)$ which we can look at it as *Error* we get, assigning vectors to words. We are getting the best vectors possible for each word by minimising it. Let us take a look at this transformation and examine the internal pieces: \n",

In order to find such vectors, we have introduced a loss function which, by minimising it, we achieve our primary goal. Minimising this cost function means maximising the total probability that our model can predict the correct context from each word.\n",

As it can be seen, we are dealing with a conditional probability or, more precisely, a probability distribution. Take another look at the result of the previous example. The last 5 lines show-for each word of 5 words - what is the probability of having such word given its context words ( lines one and five have just one expression since the only context of words 1 and 5 are respectively words 2 and 4). In order to calculate this probability, we can use a trick: Considering two different vector representations for each word based on its position, showing it with $v$ when it's a centre word and mentioning it with $u$ when it's a context word. Having such assumption, we can use the following formula:\n",

The answer - at least from the conceptual point of view - is easy: Initiate each word with a random vector, calculate the Cost Function, change the vectors in a way that give a lower cost, calculate the cost and repeat these steps until the cost can't go lower (you reach the global minimum for the cost). The following figure shows a simplistic representation of these steps:\n",

To take these steps, we need to have to things:\n",

After 6 hours,  you're somewhere near the top of a mountain, but since it's getting dark (and you're tired), you decide to go down, back to where you've parked your car. There's a thick fog in the mountain, and while you know your final destination is down (in our case, down means minimizing our cost function), you can't see the whole way until the destination point. So in this case, you decide to choose a direction that seems right to you, take some steps, evaluate your position and choose another direction. Eventually, you'll(hopefully) get to your car by repeating these actions. This is all __Gradient Descent (GD)__ does. Starting from a given initial point, it first calculates the partial depravities(A partial derivative shows you the direction of the point that makes the function minimum or maximum) then, using the step ($\\alpha$) you've defined beforehand, it updates the $\\theta$ and recalculates the cost. Repeating these steps, we'll finish with the best set of vectors for our corpus.\n",
